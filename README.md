# Project Description


Our team is developing a project similar to Krysha.kz, focusing on creating an interactive platform that bridges the gap between front-end user interactions and back-end data management. 
The project encompasses:
- Front-End: Featuring interfaces and services for API communication, including events that trigger API calls, two-way data binding, minimalistic CSS styling, configured routing, and Angular directives for dynamic content. It integrates JWT for authentication, ensuring secure login and logout functionalities.
- Back-End: Built with a model-centric approach, incorporating relational dynamics, serializers for data handling, and views for API interaction. It supports token-based authentication and offers CRUD operations for specific models, linking actions directly to authenticated users.
