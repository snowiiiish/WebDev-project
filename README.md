# Project Description


Our team is developing a project similar to Krysha.kz. It offers a wide range of listings, including apartments, houses, commercial properties, and land. The platform is designed to facilitate easy navigation and search functionalities, allowing users to filter listings based on various criteria such as location, price, and property type. 
The project encompasses:
- Front-End: Featuring interfaces and services for API communication, including events that trigger API calls, two-way data binding, minimalistic CSS styling, configured routing, and Angular directives for dynamic content. It integrates JWT for authentication, ensuring secure login and logout functionalities.
- Back-End: Built with a model-centric approach, incorporating relational dynamics, serializers for data handling, and views for API interaction. It supports token-based authentication and offers CRUD operations for specific models, linking actions directly to authenticated users.
